//You are going to be given an array of integers.
//Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N 
//is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

//For example:
//Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:
//Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array,
//the sum of left side of the index ({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.

//My solution

function findEvenIndex(arr)
{
var index = 1; 

while(index < arr.length-1){
var sum1 = 0;
var sum2 = 0;

//go forward through the array, not counting the current index,  and summing the values
for(let i = index+1; i < arr.length; i++){
sum1 += arr[i];
}
//go backward through the array, not couting the current index, and summing the values
for(let i = index-1; i>=0; i--){
sum2+=arr[i]}

if(sum1==sum2){return index}
else{index+=1}



}
return -1

}
